        Prototype Model is a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model that involves creating an early, rudimentary version of a system, software, or interface for demonstration and evaluation purposes.<br/>
        It focuses on quickly building a prototype to showcase the basic functionality and design of the final product.<br/><br/>

    <h2 id="whiteinline" style="color: white; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">Advantages</h2>
    <p class="w-2/5 self-center text-wrap ">

    <ul>
        <li>1. Rapid Prototyping: Prototype Model allows for rapid prototyping, enabling stakeholders to visualize and interact with the product early in the development process.<br/><br/></li>
        <li>2. Early Feedback: Stakeholders can provide early feedback on the prototype, allowing for iteration and refinement of the final product.<br/><br/></li>
        <li>3. Clear Requirements: Developing a prototype helps clarify and refine the requirements of the final product through hands-on exploration.<br/><br/></li>
        <li>4. Risk Mitigation: By identifying and addressing potential issues early in the development cycle, Prototype Model helps mitigate risks associated with the final product.<br/><br/></li>
        <li>5. User Involvement: Involving users in the prototyping process enhances user satisfaction and ensures that the final product meets their needs and expectations.<br/><br/></li>
        <li>6. Cost-Effective: Developing a prototype can be cost-effective as it helps identify and rectify design flaws and requirements issues early in the development process, reducing rework costs later on.<br/><br/></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2 id="whiteinline" style="color: white; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">Disadvantages</h2>
    <p class="w-2/5 self-center text-wrap ">

        <ul>
            <li>1. Limited Functionality: Prototypes may lack full functionality and may not accurately represent the final product, leading to potential misunderstandings.<br/><br/></li>
            <li>2. Time Constraints: Developing a prototype requires additional time and resources upfront, potentially delaying the overall development process.<br/><br/></li>
            <li>3. Scope Creep: Stakeholders may request additional features or changes during the prototyping phase, leading to scope creep and increased project complexity.<br/><br/></li>
            <li>4. Maintenance Overhead: Maintaining multiple prototypes and ensuring consistency between them can create additional overhead for development teams.<br/><br/></li>
            <li>5. Misleading Expectations: Stakeholders may form unrealistic expectations based on the prototype, leading to disappointment if the final product differs significantly.<br/><br/></li>
            <li>6. Limited Scalability: Prototype Model may not be suitable for large-scale projects or projects requiring extensive scalability and robustness.<br/><br/></li>
        </ul>
