                            Waterfall is one of the first software development models. The model is based on the analogy of regular production processes, where each stage precedes the next. Reverting to a previous stage is difficult. If a mistake is discovered in a previous stage, it can only be returned to after the software has been put into use.

                            1. Stage - Requirements Definition:<br/>
                            In the first stage, the requirements of the product/system to be developed are documented, including behavior, target hardware, etc., necessary for the intended functioning of the developed software. Sometimes this stage is divided into two - System Analysis and Requirements Analysis.
                            <br/><br/>
                            2. Stage - System and Software Design:<br/>
                            In the second stage, the system and software being developed are designed, focusing on their main features. These main features may include:
                            <br/>
                            - Data structures,
                            <br/>
                            - Software architectures,
                            <br/>
                            - Interfaces,
                            <br/>
                            - Interface properties,
                            <br/>
                            - And procedural and algorithmic details.
                            <br/>
                            The design result is documented, according to which the quality of the project is assessed during implementation.
                            <br/><br/>
                            3. Stage - Implementation and Module Testing:<br/>
                            According to the previously documented design, software/system development takes place in the third stage. During development, the program is developed module by module or as sets of modules. After programming, module and module set testing is performed. Depending on the detail of the previously documented design, this stage simplifies project development. The more details are planned, the easier development work is.
                            <br/><br/>
                            4. Stage - Integration and System Testing:<br/>
                            The entire software system is tested in this stage. After testing, the product is delivered to the customer/target group. It is tested from the perspective of whether the system does what was previously documented and also tests whether the logical details in the system are correct.
                            <br/><br/>
                            5. Stage - Use and Maintenance - The longest-living stage of software. Error correction and functional changes take place (even as input/needs from the customer, market, environment, or target group). To perform development work, all previous stages are repeated, but only for the purpose of modifying the system, not for developing something new from scratch.
                            <br/><br/>
                            As a result of each stage, one or more documents describing the results achieved in the stage are created. All documents are approved. The next stage must not be in progress until the previous one is completed. Although there is some overlap, and information is passed from one stage to the next.
