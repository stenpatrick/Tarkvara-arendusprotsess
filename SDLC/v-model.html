        The V-Model, also known as the Verification and Validation Model, is a software development process that emphasizes a systematic and structured approach to verification and validation.<br/>
        It is based on the idea of developing and testing in parallel, with each phase of development corresponding to a phase of testing.<br/><br/>

    <h2 id="whiteinline" style="color: white; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">Advantages</h2>
    <p class="w-2/5 self-center text-wrap ">

    <ul>
        <li>1. Structured Approach: The V-Model provides a structured approach to software development and testing, ensuring thorough verification and validation.<br/><br/></li>
        <li>2. Early Detection of Defects: By emphasizing testing in parallel with development, the V-Model facilitates early detection and correction of defects.<br/><br/></li>
        <li>3. Clear Documentation: The V-Model promotes clear documentation of requirements, design, and test cases, facilitating communication and traceability.<br/><br/></li>
        <li>4. Risk Mitigation: By addressing verification and validation activities at each stage of development, the V-Model helps mitigate project risks.<br/><br/></li>
         <li>5. Increased Quality: The systematic approach of the V-Model leads to higher-quality software products through comprehensive testing and validation.<br/><br/></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2 id="whiteinline" style="color: white; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">Disadvantages</h2>
    <p class="w-2/5 self-center text-wrap ">

        <ul>
            <li>1. Rigidity: The V-Model can be rigid and inflexible, making it challenging to accommodate changes or unexpected requirements.<br/><br/></li>
            <li>2. Sequential Nature: The sequential nature of the V-Model may lead to longer development cycles, especially for large and complex projects.<br/><br/></li>
            <li>3. Limited Customer Involvement: The emphasis on testing in parallel with development may limit customer involvement and feedback during early stages.<br/><br/></li>
            <li>4. Increased Documentation Overhead: The structured approach of the V-Model requires extensive documentation, leading to increased overhead.<br/><br/></li>
             <li>5. Late Testing: Despite testing in parallel with development, some testing activities in the V-Model may still occur late in the process, leading to potential delays in defect detection and resolution.<br/><br/></li>
        </ul>
