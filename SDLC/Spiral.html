                    Spiral Model is a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model that provides a systematic and iterative approach to software development.<br/>
                    In its diagrammatic representation, looks like a spiral with many loops.<br/>
                    The exact number of loops of the spiral is unknown and can vary from project to project. <br/>
                    Each loop of the spiral is called a Phase of the software development process.<br/><br/>

                <ul>
                    <li><a id="textcolor">1. Risk Handling: The projects with many unknown risks that occur as the development proceeds, in that case, <br/>
                    Spiral Model is the best development model to follow due to the risk analysis and risk handling at every phase.<br/><br/></li>
                    <li><a id="textcolor">2. Good for large projects: It is recommended to use the Spiral Model in large and complex projects.<br/><br/></li>
                    <li><a id="textcolor">3. Flexibility in Requirements: Change requests in the Requirements at a later phase can be incorporated accurately by using this model.<br/><br/></li>
                    <li><a id="textcolor">4. Customer Satisfaction: Customers can see the development of the product at the early phase of the software development and thus, <br/>
                    they habituated with the system by using it before completion of the total product.<br/><br/></li>
                    <li><a id="textcolor">5. Iterative and Incremental Approach: The Spiral Model provides an iterative and incremental approach to software development,<br/>
                    allowing for flexibility and adaptability in response to changing requirements or unexpected events.<br/><br/></li>
                    <li><a id="textcolor">6. Emphasis on Risk Management: The Spiral Model places a strong emphasis on risk management, <br/>
                    which helps to minimize the impact of uncertainty and risk on the software development process.<br/><br/></li>
                    <li><a id="textcolor">7. Improved Communication: The Spiral Model provides for regular evaluations and reviews, which can improve communication between the customer and the development team.<br/><br/></li>
                    <li><a id="textcolor">8. Improved Quality: The Spiral Model allows for multiple iterations of the software development process, which can result in improved software quality and reliability.<br/><br/></li>

                <p class="w-2/5 self-center text-wrap ">

                    <ul>
                        <li><a id="textcolor">1. Complex: The Spiral Model is much more complex than other SDLC models.<br/><br/></li>
                        <li><a id="textcolor">2. Expensive: Spiral Model is not suitable for small projects as it is expensive.<br/><br/></li>
                        <li><a id="textcolor">3. Too much dependability on Risk Analysis: The successful completion of the project is very much dependent on Risk Analysis. <br/>
                            Without very highly experienced experts, it is going to be a failure to develop a project using this model.<br/><br/></li>
                        <li><a id="textcolor">4. Difficulty in time management: As the number of phases is unknown at the start of the project, time estimation is very difficult.<br/><br/></li>
                        <li><a id="textcolor">5. Complexity: The Spiral Model can be complex, as it involves multiple iterations of the software development process.<br/><br/></li>
                        <li><a id="textcolor">6. Time-Consuming: The Spiral Model can be time-consuming, as it requires multiple evaluations and reviews.<br/><br/></li>
                        <li><a id="textcolor">7. Resource Intensive: The Spiral Model can be resource-intensive, as it requires a significant investment in planning, risk analysis, and evaluations.<br/><br/></li>
