                An Entity Relationship (ER) diagram is a type of flowchart that illustrates how "entities" (such as people, objects, or concepts) are related within a system.
                ER diagrams are typically used to illustrate database tables, showing how tables are related to each other.
                ERDs originated with Peter Chen in 1976.
                ERDs have three main components: entities, attributes, and relationships.
                It is a tradition for ER/data models to be built at two or three abstraction levels.
                The conceptual-logical-physical hierarchy below is used in other types of specifications and differs from the three-schema approach of software engineering:

                <a id="textcolor">
                The following are commonly used symbols in ERDs that show relationships between entities/tables.
                ERDs also have meanings for lines:
                <ul>
                    <li>A solid line indicates a strong entity relationship</li>
                    <li>A dashed line indicates a weak entity relationship</li>
                </ul>
            </a>
            </p><br>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2 id="whiteinline" style="color: #404040; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">Why Do We Use It?</h2>
            <p>
                <a id="textcolor">   
                ERDs help everyone understand the fundamentals of the data/information stored in their database. ERDs are used to design or analyze relational databases used in business processes. Such a database can benefit any business process that uses the output data, which includes entities, operations, and interactions. It can make processes smoother, information easier to find, and results improved. Without understanding the structure of the database, creating tables is very painful and often leads to errors or unnecessary columns. For example, if you create tables for students and individuals and forget to relate them to each other or add a "IdCode" column to both the student entity and the individual - there is a risk of mismatched data or unnecessary resource usage.
