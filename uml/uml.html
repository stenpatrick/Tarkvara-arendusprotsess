                UML diagrams fall into two subcategories: structural diagrams and behavioral diagrams.

                Structural diagrams depict the components that make up the system and the relationships between those components. These diagrams depict the static aspects of a system.

                Behavioral diagrams depict what happens inside the system. They show how all components interact with each other and with other systems or users.

                <p id="textcolor">
                    <a id="textcolor">
                        Structural diagrams depict a static view or structure of a system. It is widely used in the documentation of software architecture. It embraces class diagrams, composite structure diagrams, component diagrams, deployment diagrams, object diagrams, and package diagrams. It presents an outline for the system. It stresses the elements to be present that are to be modeled.

                        <li><a id="textcolor">Class Diagram: Class diagrams are one of the most widely used diagrams. It is the backbone of all the object-oriented software systems. It depicts the static structure of the system. It displays the system's class, attributes, and methods. It is helpful in recognizing the relation between different objects as well as classes.</br></a></li>
                        <li><a id="textcolor">Composite Structure Diagram: The composite structure diagrams show parts within the class. It displays the relationship between the parts and their configuration that ascertain the behavior of the class. It makes full use of ports, parts, and connectors to portray the internal structure of a structured classifier. It is similar to class diagrams, just the fact it represents individual parts in a detailed manner when compared with class diagrams.</br></a></li>
                        <li><a id="textcolor">Object Diagram: It describes the static structure of a system at a particular point in time. It can be used to test the accuracy of class diagrams. It represents distinct instances of classes and the relationship between them at a time.</br></a></li>
                        <li><a id="textcolor">Component Diagram: It portrays the organization of the physical components within the system. It is used for modeling execution details. It determines whether the desired functional requirements have been considered by the planned development or not, as it depicts the structural relationships between the elements of a software system.</br></a></li>
                        <li><a id="textcolor">Deployment Diagram: It presents the system's software and its hardware by telling what the existing physical components are and what software components are running on them. It produces information about system software. It is incorporated whenever software is used, distributed, or deployed across multiple machines with dissimilar configurations.</br></a></li>
                        <li><a id="textcolor">Package Diagram: It is used to illustrate how the packages and their elements are organized. It shows the dependencies between distinct packages. It manages UML diagrams by making it easily understandable. It is used for organizing the class and use case diagrams.</a></li>

                The UML class diagram is the basic building block of any object-oriented solution. It represents a static object-oriented system, defining projects based on classes, attributes, and functions. In other words, it shows the classes of the system and their operations. Both software engineers and business managers use it to model various interactions in the process.
                
                The diagram represents a class with a rectangle. Each rectangle is divided vertically into three parts. The top part contains the class name, while the second and third sections contain details about the class's operations, behavior, and attributes.
                
                You can easily create these diagrams using a UML class diagram tool.
                <li><a id="textcolor"><b>Package Diagram</b><br/></li>
                <a id="textcolor">
                As the name suggests, a package diagram shows dependencies and relationships between packages in the system. A package refers to anything that organizes any model element. In the diagram itself, it is represented as a folder.
                
                The package diagram allows users to group items into folders. Units that can be grouped include classes, use cases, documents, diagrams, and even other packages. Once each unit is separated into a package, all packages are arranged and ordered hierarchically in the diagram.
                
                Because they easily depict high-level structure, package diagrams are mostly useful for visualizing software systems.
                <li><a id="textcolor"><b>Object Diagram</b><br/></li>
                <a id="textcolor">
                Object diagrams show the attributes of different objects in the system. Like class diagrams, they show relationships between objects in software. The difference is that object diagrams use real-world examples. Object diagrams are also called instance diagrams because they show what the system looks like at a specific point in time.
                <li><a id="textcolor"><b>Component Diagram</b><br/></li>
                <a id="textcolor">
                A UML component diagram divides a complex system into smaller components, making visualization easier. Unlike other UML diagrams, it specifically describes the relationships between these components.
                
                UML component diagrams provide developers with a general overview of the physical objects of the system. This type of UML diagram also shows the structural relationship between each physical component and subcomponent in a complex software system. It helps stakeholders understand how components are organized and interconnected.
                
                Creating these diagrams is easy with user-friendly UML component diagram tools.

                <a id="textcolor">
                A deployment diagram shows the configuration of processing nodes and all the components living in them. It represents the physical arrangement of nodes in a distributed system. These diagrams are particularly useful when you are creating software that runs on different hardware systems.
                
                System engineers are most likely to use these diagrams as they can monitor their entire hardware network and prepare the system for deployment without issues. It also allows them to see performance, maintainability, and scalability.

            <li><a id="textcolor"><b>Behavioral Diagrams</b><br/></li>
                <a id="textcolor">
                    Behavioral diagrams are a type of diagram used in software engineering and systems design to illustrate the dynamic behavior of a system or software application. These diagrams are part of the Unified Modeling Language (UML), which is a standardized modeling language used in software development to visually represent different aspects of a system.

                    There are several types of behavioral diagrams in UML, each focusing on different aspects of system behavior:
                    
                    <li><a id="textcolor">1. Use Case Diagrams: Use case diagrams depict the interactions between actors (users or external systems) and the system under consideration. They illustrate the various ways users interact with the system to achieve specific goals.<br/></li>

                    <li><a id="textcolor">2. Sequence Diagrams: Sequence diagrams show how objects interact with each other in a particular scenario or use case over time. They emphasize the chronological sequence of messages exchanged between objects.<br/></li>
                    <li><a id="textcolor">3. Collaboration Diagrams (Communication Diagrams): Collaboration diagrams, also known as communication diagrams, illustrate the interactions between objects in terms of messages sent and received. They emphasize the structural organization of objects involved in a scenario.<br/></li>

                    <li><a id="textcolor">4. Activity Diagrams: Activity diagrams visualize the flow of control or flow of objects in a system, representing the dynamic aspects of the system's behavior. They are especially useful for modeling the workflow or business processes within a system.<br/></li>

                    <li><a id="textcolor">5. State Machine Diagrams (Statecharts): State machine diagrams, or statecharts, represent the states of an object or system and the transitions between these states in response to events. They are particularly useful for modeling the behavior of reactive systems.<br/></li>

                    <li><a id="textcolor">6. Timing Diagrams: Timing diagrams illustrate the behavior of objects in terms of time, showing how different objects interact and change state over time.<br/></li>
                    
                    These behavioral diagrams help software developers, analysts, and stakeholders understand and communicate the dynamic behavior of a system, enabling them to analyze, design, and refine the software or system under development effectively. Each type of diagram offers a unique perspective on the behavior of the system and can be used at different stages of the software development lifecycle.

                <a id="textcolor">
                The UML activity diagram is a flowchart that describes all the activities of a system. It shows everything from start to finish, defining the various decision points and steps that need to happen to move from one activity to another. Steps can be chronological, branched, or concurrent.
                
                Using UML activity diagrams, you can refine any component and get a high-level overview of the dynamic aspects of the system. The best way to create these diagrams is to use an intuitive UML activity diagram creator.
                <li><a id="textcolor"><b>Sequence Diagram</b><br/></li>
                <a id="textcolor">
                UML sequence diagrams (sometimes called event diagrams) show the sequence of interactions between your objects. This includes your object's lifelines, the processes interacting with your objects, and the messages exchanged between objects to perform a function.
                
                Developers and business professionals often use these diagrams to understand how to build a new system or improve an existing process. You can easily create them using an online UML sequence diagram.
                <li><a id="textcolor"><b>Communication Diagram</b><br/></li>
                <a id="textcolor">
                UML communication diagrams are also called collaboration diagrams. They are relatively similar to sequence diagrams, focusing on the messages transmitted between different objects. While sequence diagrams observe processing over time, communication diagrams create a complete big picture map of your product. A communication diagram tool makes creating these visualizations easy.
                Interaction Overview Diagram
                
                Similar to activity diagrams, interaction overview diagrams visualize the flow of activities and the sequence of those activities. The difference is that in the interaction overview diagram, each activity is depicted as a frame. Nodes in the interaction overview diagram represent interactions in the system.
                <li><a id="textcolor"><b>Timing Diagram</b><br/></li>
                <a id="textcolor">
                Timing diagrams are useful during deployment as they depict the behavior of specific objects over a specific period of time. These diagrams are usually quite simple, but when dealing with more than one object, they show many different and important sequences of interactions during that time.
                <li><a id="textcolor"><b>Use Case Diagram</b><br/></li>
                <a id="textcolor">
                Use case diagrams provide a graphical overview of the actors involved in a software system. By illustrating the functionality of the system and outlining the expected behavior of the system, they help developers analyze the relationships between use cases and actors. You can easily visualize these interactions using a use case diagram tool.
                <li><a id="textcolor"><b>State Machine Diagram</b><br/></li>
                <a id="textcolor">
                UML state machine diagrams, also known as statechart diagrams, show the behavior of various components in the system. You can visualize how elements behave differently depending on the state of the developing program. Easily create state diagrams with the Miro state diagram tool.
