        <p class="w-2/5 text-wrap ">Microsoft Visio (formerly Microsoft Office Visio) is a diagramming and vector graphics application that belongs to the Microsoft 365 family. The product was first introduced in 1992 by the former American software company Visio Corporation, and its latest version is Visio 2021. Microsoft acquired the assets of Visio Corporation in 2000, inheriting the licensing agreements for the Visio application. A lightweight version of Visio is now included with all commercial SKUs of Microsoft 365, known as Visio in Microsoft 365. It has two additional subscription-based SKUs. Visio Plan 1 includes the Visio web app, while Visio Plan 2 offers access to both the web app and the desktop app.</p>

        <p class="w-2/5 text-wrap ">

            Microsoft Visio is used to create various types of diagrams such as flowcharts, organizational charts, floor plans, network diagrams, UML diagrams, mind maps, and more. It is commonly used for scenarios like process mapping and visual collaboration. The latest version of Visio also includes data visualization capabilities, allowing users to create diagrams from Excel data and embed Visio diagrams into Power BI dashboards.

            Microsoft made Visio 2013 for Windows available in two editions: Standard and Professional. Both editions have the same interface, but the Professional edition includes additional templates for more advanced diagrams and layouts, as well as features designed to help users connect diagrams to data sources and facilitate graphical representation of data. The Professional edition includes three additional diagram types, as well as intelligent rules, validation, and subprocess (scheme decomposition). Visio Professional is also offered as an additional component of Office 365 subscriptions.
            
            On September 22, 2015, Visio 2016 was released alongside Microsoft Office 2016. Some new features were added, such as one-step connectivity with Excel data, Information Rights Management (IRM) protection for Visio files, modernized shapes for office layout, detailed shapes for floor plans, modern shapes for home plans, IEEE-compatible shapes for electrical schematics, a new set of starter diagrams, and new themes for the Visio interface.
            
            Database modeling in Visio revolves around the Database Model Diagram (DMD).
